Look the the Prediction_model for updates....................In my machine learning project for predicting cryptocurrency trends, I initially fine-tune functions in a Jupyter Notebook. Once these functions are optimized, I integrate them into my main project by organizing them into classes. This process involves:

    Data Handling Class: Encapsulating data loading, preprocessing, and transformation functions into a class. This class manages all interactions with the data, ensuring consistency and reusability.
    Model Class: Grouping model architecture, training, and evaluation methods into a single class. This class encapsulates all aspects of the model, making it easy to adjust parameters or swap out models without affecting other parts of the code.
    Utility Class: Creating a class for utility functions like logging, configuration management, and performance tracking. This class provides support functionalities that are used across the project.
